KHANA is a Restaurant reservation application which was made using React JS, a JavaScript library to make awesome UI ,HTML,Bootstrap, Flask and Firebase.

This application uses React JS component oriented UI creation paradigm. All components are written in HTML and CSS style and are combined to get a single build for production purpose using Webpack 5.

Front end is implemented using HTML5 and CSS and Bootstrap as our Front-end Framework.


Back end is implemented using Flask (which runs on python) and Firebase.

About Flask:
Flask is a micro web framework written in Python.Flask supports extensions that can add application features as if they were implemented in Flask itself.Extensions exist for object-relational mappers, form validation, upload handling, various open authentication technologies and several common framework related tools.


Firebase is an MBaaS (mobile backend as a service) from Google that provides all the features that most apps would need from an MBaaS, with support for both web and mobile clients
